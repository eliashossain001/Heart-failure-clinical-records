# Heart-failure-clinical-records

This project was focused on survival analysis of heart failure patients who were admitted to Institute of Cardiology and Allied hospital Faisalabad-Pakistan during April-December (2015). The dataset can be found in UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records

# Pipeline Explanation

1. Data Collection: Data Collection is main part of the Data Science Project. However, the data has been collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. Data Cleaning:   Data could be structure or unstructure. Sometimes data came from website where there is not clean data and this is why data cleaning is require in this step to remove the noise, handling the missing value, and so on. 
3. Data Processing: After Cleaning the Data, it's ready for processing where we meaningful insight can be found. In other word, Data processing is, generally, "the collection and manipulation of items of data to produce meaningful information.
4. Data Visualization: This is one of the most important task in every Data Science Project. Data visualization is the graphic representation of data. It involves producing images that communicate relationships among the represented data to viewers of the images.
5. Machine Learning Model: Now everything is ready. In this step, the predictive model building is required using various machine learning algorithm.
6. Model Evaluation: Model Evaluation is needed to ensure how good it is to develop a model.
7. Model Deployment: When everything is ready, you have to come to this step and deploy the model using different web API.

# Model Evaluation 
1.  ROC-AUC curve
2. Confusion Matrix
3. Classification Report (precision, recall, f1-score, support)

# Deep Learning Approach:
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
